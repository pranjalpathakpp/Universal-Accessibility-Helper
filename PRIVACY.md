# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Overview

Universal Web Accessibility Helper ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension processes all data locally in your browser and does not transmit any information to external servers.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The Extension:
- ✅ Operates entirely within your browser
- ✅ Uses only Chrome's local storage API for your preferences
- ✅ Does not send any data to external servers
- ✅ Does not use analytics or tracking
- ✅ Does not collect usage statistics
- ✅ Does not access your browsing history
- ✅ Does not read or transmit page content

## Data Storage

The Extension stores the following information locally on your device using Chrome's storage API:

- **Accessibility preferences**: Your selected profile (Low Vision, Dyslexia, Cognitive, or Custom)
- **Custom settings**: Any customizations you make to the Custom profile
- **Enabled state**: Whether accessibility mode is currently enabled

This data is stored locally in your browser and is never transmitted outside your device.

## Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions:

- **`storage`**: To save your accessibility preferences locally
- **`activeTab`**: To apply accessibility enhancements to the current webpage
- **`scripting`**: To inject accessibility styles and modifications
- **`<all_urls>`**: To work on any website you visit

These permissions are used solely for the Extension's functionality and are not used to collect or transmit data.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or external APIs. All processing happens locally in your browser.

## Data Sharing

**We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone.**

Since we do not collect any data, there is nothing to share.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **View your data**: All stored data is accessible through Chrome's storage API
- **Delete your data**: Uninstalling the Extension removes all stored preferences
- **No data collection**: Since we don't collect data, there's nothing to request or delete

## Open Source

This Extension is open source. You can review the code to verify our privacy practices. The source code is available in the repository.
